# Cybersecurity and Business Intelligence Professional
Hi, my name is Tatiana Mathis, and I am a Cybersecurity GRC and BI analyst.

I hold a MBA in Marketing, which gave me a strong foundation in strategic leadership, consumer behavior, market research, data analysis, and business operations. My journey began in marketing. I worked with both private sector companies and nonprofits, as well as founded Comm Geeks LLC, a small web development firm for e-commerce.

As I sought to deepen my understanding of market dynamics and data-driven decision-making, I transitioned into cybersecurity and business intelligence. 

I'm passionate about research and building solutions that help businesses safeguard their data and infrastructure. While I'm continuously learning about web development, my main focus is on applying cybersecurity principles and business intelligence to protect and empower organizations.
