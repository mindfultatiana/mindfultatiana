# Data Driven Marketing Professional
Hi, my name is Tatiana Mathis and I am a Marketer, Programmer, and Data Analyst.
I got my MBA in Marketing in 2019, which showed me consumer behavior, market research, statistics, and calculus with an emphasis on changes in the market. 
I fell in love. I had worked as a marketer for several private sector business, a couple nonprofits, and spent years as a tech founder for Comm Geeks LLC a small web development firm. 

I wanted to keep up with my industry, learn more about machine learning, and make better predictive decisions for my customers so I jumped into learning code and data science.
Now here I am growing my knowledge and finally finding my purpose. I love research and building things that help people. 
I'm excited to be a beginner in something new everyday. And though going from the business side to the tech side is an unusual route, I can see how every step helps inform my perspective along the way.
