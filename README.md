# Cybersecurity and Business Intelligence Professional
Hi, my name is Tatiana Mathis, and I am a Cybersecurity Analyst and Business Intelligence Enthusiast.

I hold a MBA in Marketing, which gave me a strong foundation in consumer behavior, market research, and data analysis. My journey began in marketing, working with both private sector companies and nonprofits, as well as founding Comm Geeks LLC, a small web development firm.

As I sought to deepen my understanding of market dynamics and data-driven decision-making, I transitioned into cybersecurity and business intelligence. 

I'm passionate about research and building solutions that help businesses safeguard their data and infrastructure. While I'm continuously learning about web development, my main focus is on applying cybersecurity principles and business intelligence to protect and empower organizations.
